        "answer": "We specialize in complex, sophisticated workflows that generic automation can't touch. If we determine during the audit that your process is too complex for AI (rare, but it happens), we'll tell you honestly—we won't waste your time or money. But in 95%+ of cases, custom-trained AI can handle far more complexity than clients expect."

        "question": "Do we need technical expertise on our team?",
        "answer": "Not at all. We handle all the technical work—development, integration, deployment, and maintenance. Your team just needs to understand your business process (which they already do). We translate your business logic into AI intelligence. No coding, no data science, no technical skills required from your side."

        "question": "What happens if the AI makes a mistake?",
        "answer": "We build in quality controls, human review checkpoints, and fallback protocols for high-stakes decisions. For critical processes, we typically deploy AI in \"assistant mode\" initially (suggests actions, human approves) before graduating to \"autonomous mode\" once accuracy is proven. And we continuously monitor performance to catch and correct any issues quickly."
