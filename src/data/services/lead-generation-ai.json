        "answer": "During setup, we work with you to define your ideal customer profile: budget range, timeline, decision authority, specific needs, company size (for B2B), and other criteria that matter to YOUR business. The AI then uses these criteria plus behavioral signals (engagement, content downloads, website activity, email opens, pages viewed) to score every lead from 0-100. You have full control over the qualification criteria and can adjust them anytime based on what's actually converting."

        "question": "What happens to leads that don't qualify immediately?",
        "answer": "They're not thrown away. Leads that don't qualify now but show some potential get added to automated nurturing sequences—periodic emails, content offers, educational resources—that keep them engaged until they ARE ready. When their behavior and engagement improve (opening emails, downloading resources, revisiting pricing page), the AI automatically re-scores them and routes them to sales when they're qualified. Nothing falls through the cracks."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of ROI can we expect?",
        "answer": "Most clients see 400-800% ROI in the first year from three main sources: (1) 60-80% reduction in cost per qualified lead, (2) 2.5-3.5X increase in sales team productivity, and (3) higher close rates from faster response to hot prospects. The average client generates **$5,000-$20,000 in additional monthly revenue** while spending LESS on marketing. Specific results depend on your industry, average deal size, and current lead quality—but we track everything and show you exactly where the ROI is coming from."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if our lead volume is low—under 50 leads per month?",
        "answer": "Lead Generation AI still provides tremendous value even with lower volume. When you only get 50 leads per month, you can't afford to waste time on the 30-35 that aren't qualified. The AI ensures your team focuses exclusively on the 15-20 that are actually worth pursuing—dramatically improving conversion rates and sales efficiency even if total volume is modest. Plus, better data on which channels drive quality helps you increase volume strategically over time."
