          One of our clients – a home repair contractor from Gunston Heights – was losing 15-20 leads every month because he couldn't answer his phone while working. That's roughly $5,000-$8,000 in lost revenue.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If I don't answer a lead in 5 minutes, they're gone," he told us. But he was always on a ladder, under a sink, or driving between jobs.
        </p>

          It's not fair that tech-savvy competitors are stealing your customers just because they respond faster. You're better at the actual work – you just can't be in two places at once.
        </p>
         <p>
          We set him up with an AI Agent that picks up every new lead, sends follow-up texts, and schedules calls. Now he captures every opportunity without ever stopping work.
