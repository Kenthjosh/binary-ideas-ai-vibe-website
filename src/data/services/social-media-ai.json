        "question": "Which social media platforms does it support?",
        "answer": "Our Social Media AI supports all major platforms including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube. We optimize content specifically for each platform's algorithm, audience, and format requirements while maintaining consistent brand messaging across all channels. For most Northern VA businesses, we focus heavily on Facebook (for local visibility), Instagram (for visual engagement), and LinkedIn (for B2B connections), with additional platforms added based on where your specific audience spends time."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can we review content before it's posted?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. You have three options based on your comfort level:<br><br>(1) <strong>Full Autopilot:</strong> AI creates and posts automatically—you just review performance weekly.<br>(2) <strong>Approval Workflow:</strong> You review and approve content batches before they go live.<br>(3) <strong>Hybrid:</strong> AI posts routine content automatically, but flags certain post types for your approval. Most clients start with approval workflows and transition to autopilot once they trust the AI's content quality."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the AI maintain our brand voice?",
        "answer": "We train the AI on YOUR specific brand voice through a comprehensive onboarding process: We analyze your existing social media content, blog posts, website copy, and customer communications. You complete a brand voice questionnaire defining your tone, style, and messaging preferences. We provide sample posts for your review and feedback before launch. The AI continuously learns from your edits and feedback to improve over time. Within 2-3 weeks, the AI produces content that accurately reflects your brand voice."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of content can the AI create?",
        "answer": "The AI creates virtually every type of social media content: Text posts (updates, announcements, thought leadership, tips), Photo posts (before-and-after showcases, product highlights, team introductions), Video scripts (short-form video, reels, stories, TikToks), Stories (daily story content for Instagram and Facebook), Carousels (multi-image educational and promotional content), Polls & Questions (interactive engagement content), Event promotions (grand openings, sales, special events), and User-generated content (amplifying customer reviews and testimonials). All content is adapted to each platform's best practices."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do we measure success?",
        "answer": "We provide comprehensive analytics dashboards that track the metrics that matter for YOUR business: Engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares, saves, story interactions), Reach metrics (impressions, profile visits, follower growth), Lead metrics (click-throughs, DM inquiries, form submissions), Conversion metrics (actual customers generated from social media), Time savings (hours saved on content creation), and ROI (revenue generated vs. cost of service). You get weekly dashboard access and monthly detailed reports showing exactly what's working."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can the AI handle negative comments or complaints?",
        "answer": "Yes, with intelligent escalation: Positive comments get appreciated responses that maintain engagement. Simple questions get immediate, accurate answers. Qualified leads get responses and immediate alerts to you for follow-up. Negative comments get flagged instantly and notify you for personal handling. Spam/trolls get identified and hidden while flagging you to review. You set the escalation rules during setup, and the AI learns from how you handle edge cases over time."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does implementation take?",
        "answer": "From decision to launch:<br><br>Day 1-2: Onboarding call, brand voice training, platform connections.<br>Day 3-5: AI training on your content, approval of initial content samples.<br>Day 6-7: Final adjustments, scheduling setup, launch preparation.<br>Day 8+: Live and posting automatically.<br><br>Most clients are fully live within 7-10 business days. During implementation, we handle all technical setup—you just provide brand information and approval."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if we want to pause or cancel?",
        "answer": "No long-term contracts or cancellation fees. You can pause or cancel anytime:<br><br><strong>Pause:</strong> Keep your account active but stop posting (useful for seasonal businesses or temporary situations).<br><strong>Cancel:</strong> Full cancellation with no penalties—you own all content created during your service period. Month-to-month flexibility means you're never locked in. We earn your business every month by delivering results, not by trapping you in contracts."
