          At a community event in Laurel Hill Park, a vendor used our AI Agent to manage RSVPs. It handled over 200 responses in one afternoon – saving them from hiring temporary staff.

          A bakery near Silverbrook Road was wasting hours every week answering "Are you open today?" on Facebook. Their AI Agent now handles that automatically, saving them 6+ hours per week.
