Simpler automations can be ready in 2-3 weeks; highly complex multi-system integrations may take 10-12 weeks."

        "question": "What data do you need to train the AI agent?",

If you don't have formal documentation, we'll help you document the process as part of the project—many of our clients discover this documentation exercise itself provides valuable insights."

      {
        "question": "Can the AI agent be modified after deployment?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Our AI agents are designed to be flexible and can be updated, retrained, or modified as your business processes evolve or requirements change. In fact, we recommend periodic optimization sessions (quarterly or semi-annually) to ensure your AI continues to improve and adapt to changing needs."

All support requests are answered within 4 hours, and we're available evenings and weekends for urgent issues."

        "question": "How do we measure the success of our custom AI agent?",

You'll have a dashboard showing exactly how much time and money the AI is saving weekly."

If we determine during the audit that your process is too complex for AI (rare, but it happens), we'll tell you honestly—we won't waste your time or money. But in 95%+ of cases, custom-trained AI can handle far more complexity than clients expect."

        "question": "Do we need technical expertise on our team?",

No coding, no data science, no technical skills required from your side."
